Project Overview: 
Utilizes R to analyze insurance claims data, applying a conservative premium-setting formula. Employs non-parametric estimates, bootstrapping, MLE, and Monte Carlo simulations to refine predictions and manage financial outliers.

Key Features: 

Data Handling: Utilizes datasets comprising 500 individual policy claims to compute premiums based on a weighted average of the expected claim size, standard deviation, and the 90th percentile of claim size.
Simulation Techniques: Employs non-parametric estimation, bootstrapping, and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to fit and assess different parametric distributions.
Extended Analysis: Includes an extended dataset to refine models and test assumptions about distribution uniformity across additional samples.

Advanced Modeling: 

Monte Carlo Simulations: Conducts aggregate loss distribution analysis for a projected year with a 100,000 sample size, considering probabilities of claim occurrences.
Outlier Management: Identifies and manages outliers to ensure accuracy in non-parametric estimations and parametric fittings.

Purpose: 
This comprehensive analysis aids in strategic decision-making for premium settings and risk management, ensuring robust risk quantification approach.

Tools Used:
Developed in R, allowing for complex data manipulation and statistical modeling.

Conclusion:
The project quantifies various risks and predicts financial positions, supporting the insurance company in maintaining solvency and stability.
